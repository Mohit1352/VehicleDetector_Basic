# VehicleDetector_Basic
Python based code that analyses a video source and tries to find blobs (representing cars) and count them.

A video source that shows a road from either the top or from the front will be analysed. If relevant sized rectangles are found, then they will be considered vehicles, and hence can be counted.

Helpful in areas requiring automation or in tasks where the number of cars might be relevant. (eg. automated Traffic Signal control).
